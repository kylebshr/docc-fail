/// If you would like to make your `ItemContent` work with the `LocalizedItemCollator`,

/// represents the primary content of your `ItemContent`; usually a name or title.
///
/// Upon collation, the `ItemContent` will then be grouped into sections according to its
/// first "character" in a localized manner.
/// ```
/// struct MyContent : ItemContent, LocalizedCollatableItemContent {

///     var collationString : String {

/// Represents an `AnyItem` which can be collated, via its vended `collationString`.
///
/// `Item` (and by extension `AnyItem`) is conditionally conformed to this protocol
/// when its `Content` conforms to `LocalizedCollatableItemContent`,

/// If you're looking for the equivalent of `UILocalizedIndexedCollation` for lists,
/// you have come to the right place.
///
/// `LocalizedItemCollator` takes in a list of unsorted content, and sorts and then
/// partitions the content into sections, returning you a list of collated sections for display.
///
/// Just like `UILocalizedIndexedCollation`, `LocalizedItemCollator` takes
/// into account the localization settings of the device, using different collation for the various
/// supported iOS languages.
///
/// Example
/// -------
/// ```
/// List { list in
///     list += LocalizedItemCollator.sections(with: items) { collated, section in
///
///         /// You are passed a pre-populated section on which you may
///         /// customize the header and footer, or mutate the content.
///
///         section.header = DemoHeader(title: collated.title)
///         section.footer = DemoFooter(title: collated.title)
///     }
/// }
///
/// ```
/// Warning
/// -------
/// Sorting and partitioning thousands and thousands of `Items` each
/// time a list updates can be expensive, especially on slower devices.
///
/// If you have a list that you wish to collate that may contain thousands of items,
/// it is recommended that you store the list pre-collated outside of Listable,
/// so each recreation of the list's view model does not re-partake in an expensive sort operation.
/// Instead only re-collate when the underlying list receives an update (from Core Data, an API callback, etc).
